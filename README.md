# Olkinyei Expeditions

A cinematic six-page luxury safari experience for Olkinyei Expeditions. The application combines editorial art direction, GSAP storytelling, Framer Motion transitions, a lightweight React Three Fiber atmosphere, an end-to-end booking flow, and an authenticated Supabase-ready operations studio.

## Experience

- Six public routes: Home, Our Story, Safari Experiences, Destinations, Field Notes, and Contact / Booking
- Full-bleed migration film, image parallax, SplitText reveals, ScrollTrigger sequences, SVG morphing, magnetic controls, page transitions, and reduced-motion fallbacks
- Eight detailed safari journeys with galleries, route maps, seasonality, pricing, inclusions, exclusions, and direct booking
- Interactive Kenya and Tanzania destination map
- Filterable masonry gallery, drone film, guest journals, and fullscreen lightbox
- Three-step booking flow with validation, availability guidance, generated references, confirmation output, and booking lookup
- Private operations studio for bookings, pricing, content, media, articles, guides, vehicles, availability, invoices, and analytics
- Supabase persistence, Realtime booking events, authenticated staff access, Storage policies, and email confirmation Edge Function
- Responsive layouts, keyboard focus states, semantic landmarks, reduced motion, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots, and installable manifest

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
3. Add your Supabase project URL and publishable key.
4. Start the Vite development server with `npm run dev`.

Without Supabase credentials, the site enters a clearly labelled demonstration mode. Bookings, content edits, prices, and media changes persist in local storage. This fallback is intended for design review only, not production. With Supabase connected, the shared database is the single source of truth for every CMS-managed collection (site settings, pages, packages, blog, testimonials, destinations, guides, vehicles, customers, and media), so edits reach every browser and device.

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL editor.
3. Run the incremental migrations in order:
   `auth_schema_sync.sql`, `role_canonicalization.sql`, `blog_posts_sync.sql`,
   `bookings_hardening.sql`, `cms_content.sql`, `packages_sync.sql`,
   `testimonials_moderation.sql`, `testimonials_sources.sql`, and
   `cms_global_sync.sql` (adds destinations/guides/vehicles/customers/media
   columns, the `media_assets` table, RLS, Realtime, and seed data).
4. Run `supabase/public_read_restore.sql` last. It (re)creates the anonymous
   SELECT policies and grants that let the public website read published
   packages, destinations, guides, media, blog posts, and testimonials. It
   never deletes, updates, truncates or reseeds any row — it is safe to re-run.
   If the public site shows empty safaris/destinations while the CMS still
   shows them, this is almost always because this read path was missing.
4. Create the first staff user in Authentication.
5. Add a matching row to `public.profiles` with the user's auth UUID and role `admin`.
6. Enable Realtime for `public.bookings` if the final statement in the schema is skipped by an existing publication.
7. Deploy `supabase/functions/send-booking-confirmation`.
8. Configure `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BOOKING_TEAM_EMAIL`, and `BOOKING_FROM_EMAIL` as Edge Function secrets.
9. Add the Vite public credentials from `.env.example` to the Vercel project.

The browser receives only Supabase's publishable key. Row-level security limits sensitive reads and updates to authenticated staff. Email provider credentials remain inside the Edge Function.

## Deployment

Deploy the repository to Vercel as a Vite application. `vercel.json` rewrites all six client routes to the application shell and sets baseline security headers. Replace `https://olkinyei.com` in `index.html`, `public/robots.txt`, and `public/sitemap.xml` if the production domain differs.

## Media

The editorial photography and films are delivered from Pexels CDN with explicit image transforms, lazy loading below the fold, deferred gallery video loading, and posters. For production ownership, migrate approved files into the configured `expedition-media` Supabase Storage bucket and update the CMS records.

## Quality Checks

- Production compile: `npm run build`
- Verify keyboard navigation and focus states on all six routes
- Test reduced motion with the operating system preference enabled
- Submit a booking in both local and Supabase modes
- Verify customer and team emails from the deployed Edge Function
- Test staff authentication and booking status updates under RLS
